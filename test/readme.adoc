This folder contains a php script to verify the complete DataVaccinaor Vault API functionality.

== Run a test example
The test script needs the url (and port) of the service to test. Call it like this:

----
php vaccinator_test.php http://127.0.0.1:8080
----

The above will connect to localhost on port 8080.

----
php vaccinator_test.php https://service.mydomain.com
