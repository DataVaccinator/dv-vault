This folder contains php scripts to verify the complete DataVaccinaor Vault API functionality.

== Run a protocol test
The test script needs the url (and port) of the service to test. Call it like this:

----
php vaccinator_test.php http://127.0.0.1:8080
----

The above will connect to localhost on port 8080.

----
php vaccinator_test.php https://service.mydomain.com
----

The above will connect using https connection to service.mydomain.com (port 443 by default).

All tests have to return like this (positive example result):
----
Get version and check availability:
- pass
NOTE: Server supports 'search' module. We will test this, too.
NOTE: Server supports 'publish' module. We will test this, too.

Testing invalid requests (wrong data, missing data etc):
- pass
- pass
- pass
- pass
- pass

Testing to add data:
NOTE: New user VID: 8111823e306f95b93f67559aa205b874
- pass

Testing to publish data:
- pass
- pass
NOTE: New published user VID: 22eb8014df566c4ccceb2c0ec8109785
- pass

Tests updating data:
- pass
- pass
- pass
- pass

Tests retrieving data:
- pass
- pass

Testing 'search' plugin functions:
- pass
- pass

Testing 'publish' plugin functions:
- pass
- pass

Cleanup vid's created:
Removing vid [8111823e306f95b93f67559aa205b874]... OK
Removing vid [22eb8014df566c4ccceb2c0ec8109785]... OK

Done

== Run a speed test

This is an example call to measure the localhost system performance:

----
php perf_test.php 1 vaccinator http://localhost:8080 30 4
----

The above call will do a test with:

* provider id *1*
* provider password *vaccinator*
* system at *localhost* port *8080*
* running for *30* seconds
* utilizing *4* instances

Output:
----
Start client 0...
Start client 1...
Start client 2...
Start client 3...

=== Interpretation of the results

All the instances return their own metrics. To get the final metrics, you can add the values. In the above example, each instance did about 20 operations/sec. So the overall number of operations was 4 x ~20 = *~80 operations/sec*. Doing the exact calculation, it was *83.91 operations/sec* or *302K operations/hour*.

[NOTE]
====
The above example was generated on a virtual machine (VBox):

Operating System: KDE neon 5.19 +
Kernel Version: 5.4.0-72-generic +
OS Type: 64-bit +
Processors: 2 × Intel® Core™ i5-7600K CPU @ 3.80GHz +
Memory: 5,8 GiB of RAM +

This machine was also running the connected single instance of Cockroach Database and the test script itself. ~50% of the system performance was utilized by Cockroach DB, ~20% by dv-vault executable.

Please note that a production system with 4 CPU cores and 16GB of memory would do much more!
