{empty}

This folder contains compiled setups, ready for distribution on Linux machines (Debian, Ubuntu, RedHAT, CentOS, Suse, Arch).

Due to save space and prevent the repository from getting bigger and bigger, the setups are not pushed to repository.

== Manual creation of setups

The setups are created by calling
----
make VERSION=1.0.0
----
from the main directory.

== Cleanup
----
make clean
----
This deletes the temporary files needed for setup creation and all setups in "setup" folder.

== Run setups

Run the downloaded setups like this
----
sudo sh dv-vault-1.0.0_x86_64_setup.sh
----
