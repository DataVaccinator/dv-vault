    "listenPort": 443,

This are the available options and their meanings:

[cols="1,3"]
|=====
|Parameter | Description

|connectionString
|This is the database connection string for the CockroachDB.

Reference: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING

|maxConnections
|This value determines how many database connections the DataVaccinator keeps in his connection pool. If you specify *0* (which means *auto*), it will multiply the number of CPU cores (incl. hyperthreading) with 3.

Reference: https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/connection-pooling.html#sizing-connection-pools

|listenIP
|The IPv4 address to listen to. If you keep it empty, it listens on all available interfaces. Default is empty string.

|listenPort
|Set the port to listen to. This value must be set. For SSL connections (https), set to 443.

|useLetsEncrypt
|Set to *1* if you like to let DataVaccinator use Let's Encrypt certificate automatically. Default is *0*.

|debugMode
|Set to *1* if you like to get additional debug information to StdOut. Default is *0*.

|IPExtractor
a|If not set (empty string), the DataVaccinator will determine source IP addresses by using the network layer.

In some cases, behind loadbalancers or proxy servers, this will return the same IP for all requests. Here you can advise to use other headers. The following values are available:

. *XFF* -> Using the X-Forwared-For header
. *REALIP* -> Using the X-Real-IP header
